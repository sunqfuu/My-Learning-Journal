**My Learning Journal** is a **Scrimba Solo Project** where I built a blog-style learning journal. It’s designed to showcase recent posts, navigate to full articles, and give the feel of a personal tech journal.

Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project helped solidify concepts like semantic markup, component structuring, and basic client-side routing.
